# Accelerometer-based-hand-controlled-robot.
Controlling robot with hand gesture using accelerometer sensor and sending the data via RF sensor and handling the direction with arduino and H-bridge motor IC.

# First learn to use accelerometer(ADXL345) sensor through arduino.
Use adxl_accel.ino to learn this and read the file.
