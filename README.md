# Accelerometer-based-hand-controlled-robot.
Controlling robot with hand gesture using accelerometer sensor and sending the data via RF sensor and handling the direction with arduino and H-bridge motor IC.

# First learn to use accelerometer(ADXL345) sensor through arduino.
Use adxl_accel.ino to learn this and read the file.
The accelerometer module has 5 pins, namely
1.   GND-To be connected to Arduino's GND
2.   VCC-To be connected to Arduino's 5V
3.   X-To be connected to Analog Pin A5
4.   Y-To be connected to Analog Pin A4
5.   Z-To be connected to Analog Pin A3
